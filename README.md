the funny vegetable framework, this serves as my general graphics playground. Powered by OpenGL4 (through OpenTK)

# What
[infinite monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) but it's being applied to writing a C# graphics framework. This is literally a worse version of [osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework), if you're looking for something similar just use that.

This framework features an awful mismatch of imperative and declerative programming styles to iterate interfaces in a concise yet comprehensive fashion. What you're looking at here is the culmination of years of wasted time and effort to produce what is subpar at best!

## Why
I like writing code that does nothing impressive.

# Contribution
**Although the code is open source, the general development process will be largely kept to myself**. Feel free to raise issues about information regarding a task you wish to complete. 

# Getting started
Later, the framework will move towards using NuGet packages. Currently your most viable option is to either submodule the framework and use the code directly or wait a little longer for things to settle. Ensure you have the following:

- OpenGL 4+ 
- .NET 6
