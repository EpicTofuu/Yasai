the funny vegetable framework, this serves as my general graphics playground. Powered by SDL.

# What
[infinite monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) but it's being applied to writing a C# graphics framework. 

This framework features an awful mismatch of imperative and declerative programming styles to iterate interfaces in a concise yet comprehensive fashion. What you're looking at here is the culmination of years of wasted time and effort to produce what is subpar at best!
